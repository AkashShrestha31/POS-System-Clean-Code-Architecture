This is a Point of Sale (POS) system built using the Flutter framework, following the Clean Architecture principles and utilizing the BLoC state management pattern. The app provides an intuitive and efficient solution for managing sales, inventory, and customer interactions for businesses.

## Features

- **BLoC State Management:** The BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern is employed to manage the app's state in a predictable and efficient manner. This ensures that UI components remain responsive while keeping business logic isolated.

- **Efficient User Interface:** The app offers a user-friendly interface designed with a focus on usability and productivity. The UI is optimized for both mobile and tablet devices, providing a seamless experience.

- **Sales Management:** Users can process sales transactions, add items to the cart, apply discounts, and manage payment methods.

- **Inventory Management:** The app allows for easy management of inventory. Users can add, edit, and delete products, track stock levels, and receive alerts for low stock items.

- **Customer Interactions:** The system provides features for managing customer profiles, tracking purchase history, and applying loyalty programs.

- **Reports and Analytics:** Generate detailed reports and analytics to gain insights into sales trends, popular products, and revenue streams.
